"""
Few simple lifecycles for the handlers.

New lifecycles can be implemented the same way: accept ``handlers``
in the order they are registered (except those already succeeded),
and return the list of handlers in the order and amount to be executed.

The default behaviour of the framework is the most simplistic:
execute in the order they are registered, one by one.
